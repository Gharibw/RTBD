Cars are equipped with various types of sensors that notify the current status the car. Moreover, new automotive technologies exist, such as Connected Cars, Android Auto, and CarPlay, which are built to provide some effective solutions like automatic notification of crashes, speed notifications, in addition to entertainment purposes.
However, to our knowledge, there is no system that prevent emergencies based on the current situation of the car. Thus, we combined the use of sensors’ functions with the new car technologies to read sensory data from the car, apply machine learning algorithms on it, and prevent possible emergency situations. Moreover, our system provides a platform for automatic maintenance scheduling and monitoring.
